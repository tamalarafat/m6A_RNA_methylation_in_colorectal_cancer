# m6A_RNA_methylation_in_colorectal_cancer

Comprehensive analysis of nanopore (ONT) direct long-read RNA sequencing data maps Mettl3-mediated m6A RNA methylation patterns in colorectal carcinoma cell lines HCT116 and DLD-1.

To capture and quantify full-length transcripts and RNA modifications, specifically N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in this study, nanopore direct long-read RNA sequencing was employed using the PromethION device, coupled with flow cell FLO-PRO004RA and the direct RNA sequencing kit SQK-RNA004. This sequencing approach was applied to two colorectal carcinoma cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT116, under two conditions: control and METTL3 (Methyltransferase 3) KI (gene knock-in) using siRNA.
DLD-1 is a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line derived from the large intestine of a colon adenocarcinoma patient, while HCT116 is a widely used human colon cancer cell line for studying colon cancer proliferation. METTL3 encodes the enzyme METTL3, which acts as an m6A methyltransferase. In most cancers, METTL3 functions as an oncogene by applying m6A modifications to crucial mediators and transcripts, promoting cancer initiation and development. However, METTL3 can also function as a tumor suppressor, where its m6A mRNA modifications promote tumor suppressor proliferation, migration, and invasion.

Nanopore direct RNA sequencing generates reads as "squiggle" or ionic current signals, stored in pod5 format (Jain et al., 2022). Importantly, since full-length transcripts are sequenced directly, without cDNA conversion or PCR amplification, the base modification information is retained in the sequence data. Transcriptomic profiles were generated for both cell lines under the two conditions, resulting in four samples. __The goal of this study is to map the impact of METTL3 catalytic activity on m6A signatures across these conditions and cell lines.__
